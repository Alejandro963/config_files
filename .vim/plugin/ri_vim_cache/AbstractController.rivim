= AbstractController

(from gem actionpack-3.2.9)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Includes <tt>url_for</tt> into the host class (e.g. an abstract controller or
mailer). The class has to provide a <tt>RouteSet</tt> by implementing the
<tt>_routes</tt> methods. Otherwise, an exception will be raised.

Note that this module is completely decoupled from HTTP - the only requirement
is a valid  <tt>_routes</tt> implementation.
